# Description
My solutions to [LeetCode](leetcode.com) problems. These are here mostly for my own use in tracking how often I solve problems, how many problems I've solved, and when I go back to change existing solutions. I also often use these snippets (if they're decent) in other projects/competitions. Most of the solutions are in C++, Java, or Bash. 

# Disclaimer
None of these solutions are guaranteed to be optimal. If you see something you'd like to fix, feel free to submit a pull request.
